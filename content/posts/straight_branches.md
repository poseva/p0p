Using tig as GitLens alternative for viewing git log as straight branches.
<!--more-->

# Can't git without tig

At some point in time, all of us encountered what I call "spagitty" log that looks
something like this:

Whoa... making sense of that history will take you some time but not
if you have the right tools, and here is where `tig`[1] comes in:

Looking at those straight branches makes you wonder why the heck we 
don't have this option as an option in `git log` directly.

I would not have discovered straight branches if it wasn't for
VS Code extension GitLens and I wouldn't have discovered `tig`
if GitLens would have allowed a monthly payment instead of an yearly
one.

The pure beauty of straigt branches reminds me of something I liked
doing as a kid... combing the fringes of our living room persian carpet.
